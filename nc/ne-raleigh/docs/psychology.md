# Dog Psychology
My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing
reasonablly priced services focused on helping dogs with the challenges
associatd in living with humans.

I use an approach similar to Cesar Millan. The services that I provide are
not associated with Cesar Millan in any way beyond the fact that I am inspired
by his approach and seek to understand the psychological challenges individual
dogs have so I can help them and their owners communicate better. The key to
obtaining good behavior from dogs is to help them and their owners communicate
well. Dogs want to please their pack leaders and as such once we have good
communication the dog will be comfortable with requests such as sit, stay,
walk, come, leave-it, etc. A dog with a good understanding of their
psychological world will be safe and happy in human society.

The needs of the dog and their family will be considerd as we build a custom
plan to support the dog's psychological health. Most dogs will respond
positively after only a few sessions. On the other hand, some dogs **need**
monthly or weekly psychology sessions depending on their needs and the
expectations of their owners and the other humans the dog interacts with.
Each session is limited to one dog but as many human members of the dogs
family can attend.

Some high energy young dogs and/or working breeds also need weekly sessions.
I can help you to better understand your dogs needs ater your dog spends some
time with me at "doggy daycare".
