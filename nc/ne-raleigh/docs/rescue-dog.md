# Rescue Dogs
Every dog that I have owned has been from a shelter or a direct rescue.

I have had many direct rescue dogs from here in Wake county and other places
including a three legged dog that my wife and I encountered in the Dominican
Republic. Through rescue I worked with a totally deaf dog and others with other
special needs. I owned an unplanned three legged puppy as a result of a a trip
to the Dominican Republic.

Pet adoption is a great thing to do but it is not always the best path for
every family.

## Upside of Pet Adoption
1. You are saving a life
2. As good as **pure** breeds
3. Sometimes **BETTER** then **pure** breeds
4. Generally less expensive
5. With foster you can try before you buy

## Downside of Pet Adoption
1. Sometimes you have behavior and or health problems
2. You are forming a potentially lifelong relationship with an unknown dog
3. It is hard to predict the dog's personality
4. The dog might not have **the look** you desire
5. It is hard to sort through all the options

## My recommendation
Unless you have a large budget, specific needs, and are willing to spend a
signifigant time researching various breeders I recommend adopting a dog from
a shelter. Many purebred dogs from breeders who are attempting to make a profit
in a difficult marketplace suffer from inbreeding and genetic problems. Some
breeders attempt to run **puppy-mills** and do not have the resources, skills,
or temperament to produce good results. If you have the budget and do your
research I fully support working with an AKC Registered breeder but be prepared
to pay thousands of dollars and make sure you are not supporting a
**puppy-mill**.

## The Best Pet Adoption Plan
To succeed at Pet Adoption visit animals are the shelter and take them for a
walk so you can observe them outside the facility. If possible take the dog
home for a night or two or start as a foster before you decide to make a
lifelong commitment.

Once you make a commitment to a dog, build **trust**, **respect**, and **love**
with your new family member. Rescue dogs need time to build trust with you and
this trust must be connected with respect. Training should be part of every
interaction you have with your dog. It is very hard for two different species
to communicate. Your dog will have trouble understand you and you will have
trouble understanding your dog. Since _most_ humans are smarter than _most_
dogs it is the responsibility of the humans to do the extra work needed for
this communication. **Love** comes naturally once we have good communication!

Investing in our dog training services can help you and your rescue dog build
the skills needed to communicate well. Your dog wants the relationship to
succeed but may struggle to understand what humans expect. You also want the
relationship to succeed but may need help with cross species communication
skills.
