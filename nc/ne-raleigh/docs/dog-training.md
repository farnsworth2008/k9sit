# Dog Training
The **K9 Sit** project is currently a one man show created by me
*(Mark Farnsworth)*.

My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing a
reasonablly priced services for dogs and their owners. The best outcome for
dogs and their owners comes from developing  **trust, respect, and love**
through better communication. With good communication perform well for their
humans.

## Pricing

Quality dog training is an investment that has a huge return for you and your
dog. Especially in the case of a young dog the work we do will be something
that benefits the dog and their humans for an entire lifetime. We can also
teach old dogs new tricks and heal psychological scars. I care about the work
that I do and will not sell you services you and your dog don't need.

### $125.00 -- K9 Training
Our 45 minute **K9 Training** session is how all clients get started in my K9
training programs. This is a chance for a dog and the dog's owner to meet with
me in person. We will discuss the dog's current behaviors, goals, and coach
both the dog and the dog's owner so they leave with the skills needed to
improve.

The K9 Training program is adapted for the needs of every dog/owner team.

All dogs and their owners must complete this **K9 Training** program before
participating in any other training services I provide. Please call us before
or after you buy so we can arrange the exact day and time for the service.

### $675.00 -- Custom K9 package
Our custom packages are sold at the $675 dollar rate. These packages are
defined based on conversations with the dog owners so we can orient the
training around what the dog needs at a given time. Packages can be built for
puppies, basic obedience, service dogs, etc. Many goals can be met with one or
two custom packages.  Some goals such as becomming a North Carolina registered
service animal will require multiple packages to achieve the required results.
