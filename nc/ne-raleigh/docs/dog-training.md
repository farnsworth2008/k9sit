# Dog Training
The **K9 Sit** project is currently a one man show created by me
*(Mark Farnsworth)*.

My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing
reasonablly priced services for dogs and their owners. The best outcome for
dogs and their owners comes from developing **trust**, **respect**, and
**love** through better communication. The investment you make in building
communication with your dog will change both of your lives.

## Pricing

### $125.00 -- Primary K9 Training (two 45 minute sessions)
Our **Primary K9 Training** package is how all clients get started in my K9
training program.

I adapt the program for the needs of every dog/owner team. The primary training
package is a how all customers get started. We will discuss the dog's current
behaviors, goals, and coach you and your dog or puppy to provide the skills
needed to improve.

The K9 Training package includes two 45 minute sessions. These sessions are
usually delivered over two or three consecutive weeks. This allows me to get
to know you and your dog. For some dogs/owner teams this is all that is needed
while others will want to go further and develop an on-going trainer
relationship. Often with puppies, there is a benefit to have this program once
when the puppy is between 10 weeks and five months old. Once the puppy is older
we can do the adult version of this program.

All dogs and their owners must complete this **Primary K9 Training** program
before participating in any other training services. Please call me at
**919-809-9328** so we can arrange the exact day and time for the service.

Call or text me at **919-809-9328** to confirm date. You may pay by check or
credit card once we complete the service.

### $225.00 -- 6 hour K9 session
Our six hour session is a great way to improve your dog. A dog in this program
spends the day with me in my home. On the training day the dog gets a huge
amount of individual attention over the course of the training day. The dog's
owner can join me for around 45 minutes at the end of the training day so we
can discuss their dog's progress and future needs.

### $375.00 -- Custom K9 package
Our custom packages are sold at the $375 dollar rate. These packages are
defined based on conversations with the dog owners so we can orient the
training around what the dog needs at a given time. Packages can be built for
puppies, basic obedience, service dogs, etc. Many goals can be met with one or
two custom packages.  Some goals such as becomming a North Carolina registered
service animal will require multiple packages to achieve the required results.
