# Training
The **K9Me.com** training program are provided through our mentoring program.

We believe that mentorship is the best way to learn about dog training.

Dog trainers are paired with mentors who work with them to evaluate their
current knowlege. Mentors provide lecture as well as assign required reading
and video viewing work.

Mentors guide indivudals through the process and help prepare them for
certification.

# Pricing
The cost of mentoring with training is described on the [mentoring page](mentoring).

New dog trainers need **six month** of training and mentoring before they are
ready to take the [K9Me.com certification](certification) test. In this period
of time perspective dog trainers will read the following books and discuss the
content with their mentor. Your training mentor will also suggest additional
books, articles, and videos as your knowlege of dog training grows.
