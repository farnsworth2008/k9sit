X-1 is a puppy that I am fostering in conjunction with a local rescue
organization.

His name is pronounced “X” or if you like “Ex”. Yeah… it may not be his
fur-ever name, but so far, I actually enjoy calling him “X” and he seems to
like the sound. He is a fun guy and "X" is a fun sound.

I have no idea what breed X is but I will have him for at least four weeks as
we work through house breaking, puppy socilization, and the very start of
puppy level obedience training.

The idea with project X is to foster puppies to the point where they are
exceptionally well behaved and adoptable dogs.

Let me know if you are in interested in meeting Puppy "X". Once he is ready he
will be adoptable through [Saving Grace](https://savinggracenc.org/) animal
adoption.

A laundry basic is a very useful tool when working with a puppy. It is easy to
move the basket from one room to another and provides a bit of containment for
periods when the puppy is not in a crate and you not ready to be fully free in
the house. The basket helps with "house breaking" the puppy.
