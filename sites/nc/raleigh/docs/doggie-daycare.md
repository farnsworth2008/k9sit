## Service Providers
In our dog sitting program your dog may stays in the home of one of our dog
trainers, an assistant dog trainer, or a part time dog sitter we work with. Our
service providers represent our brand and as such we are very selective. Your
dog will be safe and comfortable with us.

All our service providers have homes with fenced yards. Your dog will have
supervised playtime with other dogs as well as two short walks as part of their
stay with our service providers. The walks are important because dogs benefit
from high quality interactions with handlers and generally do not like to poop
in our playground spaces.

The people who provide services for our network of experienced pet sitters love
having well behaved guest dogs in their homes. We only accept well trained dogs
for dog sitting or doggie day. You must be able to demonstrate that your dog
can pass the [K9Sit.com "Green" Test](the-test) or [The AKC Canine Good Citizen™ test](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/)
to qualify for our dog sitting program. We do not require the test for puppies
under seven months of age who are enrolled in our training programs.

Any dog or puppy that has signs of severe separation anxiety, aggression, or
other problems can not stay in our **K9Sit.com** dog sitting service or
attend or doggie daycare programs. We can resolve these issues in our
[dog training](dog-training) program where we train and rehabilitate dogs.

Our service providers apply the following rules for doggie daycare in their homes.

1. Dogs stay a maximum of ten hours _(or dog sitting prices apply)_
2. Poop is always picked up **IMMEDIATELY**!
3. Dogs always have access to water
4. Dogs must wear a collar with a name tag, contact information, and rabbies tag
5. No choke chain, prong, or electric shock collars are allowed _(vibrate and/or beep collars are allowed at in some special cases)_
6. Leashes similar to the [Cesar Millan Slip Lead Leash™ - Slip Collar Training Lead](https://www.amazon.com/Cesar-Millan-Leash-Training-Regular/dp/B071PDPZK6) are used for walks
7. Dogs are not allowed to drag the service provider around _(The service provider will wait and/or change direction)_
8. Dogs must stop and sit and before crossing streets
9. Dogs are not allowed to lunge, bark, or growl at dogs or people _(If this occurs the dog must sit for 5 seconds per infraction)_
10. The dog must have fun!
