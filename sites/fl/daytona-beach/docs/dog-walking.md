## Service Providers
Our dog walking service complements the train services we offer. Our dog
walkers all meet reguarly with **K9Sit.com** trainers to discuss techniques and
ensure they have an understanding of how we differ from other brands. We focus
on a positive experience for dogs and never use harsh "corrections". When a
**K9Sit.com** service provider walks a dog they integrate basic training with
the walk. In addition to providing your dog a bit of exercise and recreation
our dog walking service helps your dog to be a good dog using consistent
positive reinforcement. Since all our dog walking service providers must be
approved by one of our lead trainers you can be confident that a dog walk
provided by **K9Sit.com** will be a great experience.
