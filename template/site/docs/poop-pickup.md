# Poop Pickup
It is important to pick up the poop in your yard. Dogs don't enjoy living in
the bathroom. Poop in the yard is also unhealthy for pets and other family
members.

One of the services that I offer is to stop by your house check in on your dog
and pick up poop in the dog's yard. This service can be provided on its own or
in conjuntion with dog training.

<b>This service is only offered for houses within the 5401 Neighborhood of
North Raleigh.</b>

### $45.00 -- 20 minute poop pickup service 
The twenty minute K9 poop pickup service allows us to clean most yards.

Call or text to schedule services.
