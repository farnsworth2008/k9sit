Zeus is a strong high energy two year old dog who had a big problem pulling on
the leash.

When a 70 pound Pit Bull is pulling at the leash it scares people. It is also
no fun to walk when the dog is dragging people around. In such a large dog this
is a risky behavior.

Zeus is also **potentially** dangerous because he has not had much
socialization and might not handle a confrontation well. In Zeus' mind he just
wants to rush over to people and other dogs to give love and play but with his
size the issue could get out of control since he does not yet understand how to
manage his mental state.

I am working with him to help him become a better neighborhood dog. One
technique that helps him with his excessive energy is walking stairs. This
simple experience helps him walk in sync with his handler. It is also great
exercise for the dog and owner provided you are both healthy. With a large
pitbull like Zeus it is very important to carefully monitor him for any sign
of distress and not perform too much of this activity because walking up
stairs is hard on his short hind legs with his large body.

We only do a bit of this to help him get his mind and gait in sync with mine.
I give him plenty of rest and we don't do too many trips up the stairs.
