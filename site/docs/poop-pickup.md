# Poop Pickup
If you have a yard for your dog it is important to pick up the poop because
dogs don't enjoy living in the bathroom. Poop in the yard is also unhealth for
pets and other family members.

One of the services that I offer is to stop by your house check in on your dog
and pick up poop in the dog's yard. This service can be provided on it's own or
in conjuntion with dog training.

### $45.00 -- 20 minute poop pickup session
Our twenty minute K9 session poop pickup session allows us to clean most yards.
This service is only offered for houses within the 5401 Neighborhood of North
Raleigh.
