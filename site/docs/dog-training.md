# Dog Training
The **K9 Sit** project is currently a one man show created by me
*(Mark Farnsworth)*.

My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing a
reasonablly priced services for dogs and their owners. The best outcome for
dogs and their owners comes from developing  **trust, respect, and love**
through better communication. With good communication perform well for their
humans.

### 4 hour K9 session for $175.00

Our four hour session is a great way to improve your dog. I work with no more
then two dogs per day in this program. Each dog gets a huge amount of
individual attention over the course of the training day. The dog's owner
should join me for at least 45 minutes at the end of the training day so we can
discuss their dog's progress and future needs.
