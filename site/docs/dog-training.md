# Dog Training
The **K9 Sit** project is currently a one man show created by me
*(Mark Farnsworth)*.

My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing a
reasonablly priced services for dogs and their owners. The best outcome for
dogs and their owners comes from developing  **trust, respect, and love**
through better communication. With good communication perform well for their
humans.

Please call <b>919-809-9328</b> to dog discuss Dog training training services.
