# Dog Training
The **K9 Sit** project is currently a one man show created by me
*(Mark Farnsworth)*.

My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing a
reasonablly priced services for dogs and their owners. The best outcome for
dogs and their owners comes from developing  **trust, respect, and love**
through better communication. With good communication perform well for their
humans.

## Pricing

Quality dog training is an investment that has a huge return for you and your
dog. Especially in the case of a young dog the work we do will be something
that benefits the dog and their humans for an entire lifetime. We can also
teach old dogs new tricks and heal psychological scars. I care about the work
that I do and will not sell you services you and your dog don't need.

### $125.00 -- 45 minute K9 session
Our 45 minute **Basic Training** K9 session is our most popular program. This
is a chance for me to work with a dog and their owner to discuss the dog's
behavior and coach the owner so they leave with the skills needed to improve
their dog on their own. All dogs must complete our **Basic Training** program.

### $45.00 -- 20 minute K9 session
Our twenty minute K9 session provides a chance for your dog to keep their
skills sharp and/or grow in a small way. These short sessions are conducted
with me and one dog. The dog's owner is enencouraged to attend the training
session so I can share tips and explain how they can train the dog on their
own. These sessions can also be included as add-ons for Rover pet sitting,
walks, and/or doggy daycare.

Our **Basic Training** is a prerequisite for this session.

### $675.00 -- Custom K9 package
Our custom packages are sold at the $675 dollar rate. These packages are
defined based on conversations with the dog owners so we can orient the
training around what the dog needs at a given time. Packages can be built for
puppies, basic obedience, service dogs, etc. Many goals can be met with one or
two custom packages.  Some goals such as becomming a North Carolina registered
service animal will require multiple packages to achieve the required results.

Our **Basic Training** is a prerequisite for this package.
