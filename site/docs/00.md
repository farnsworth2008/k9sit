# Dog Psychology
The **K9 Sit** project is currently a one man show created by me
*(Mark Farnsworth)*.

My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing a
reasonablly priced service focused on helping them with the psychological
challenges associatd with living with humans.

I use an approach similar to Cesar Millan. The services that I provide are
not associated with Cesar Millan in any way beyond the fact that I am inspired
by his approach and seek to understand the psychological challenges individual
dogs have so I can help them and their owners communicate better. The key to
obtaining good behavior from dogs is to help them and their owners communicate
well. Dog's want to please their pack leaders and as such once we have good
communication the dog will be comfortable with requests such as sit, stay,
walk, come, leave-it, etc. A dog with a good understanding of their
psychological world will be safe and happy in human society.

The needs of the dog and their family will be considerd as we build a custom
plan to support the dog's psychological health. Most dogs will respond
positively after only a few sessions. On the other hand, many dogs **need**
monthly or weekly psychology sessions depending on their needs and the
expectations of their owners and the other humans the dog interacts with.
Each session is limited to one dog but as many human members of the dogs
family can attend.

Some high energy young dogs and/or working breeds also need weekly sessions.
After your dog spends some time with me at "doggy daycare" I can help you to
better understand your dogs needs.

Please call <b>919-809-9328</b> to schedule psychology services.

Psychology services can be integrated with <a href="https://www.rover.com/members/mark-f-high-quality-dog-training/">Rover.com</a> care
at my home in North Raleigh.

## Pricing

Quality dog training is an investment that has a huge return for you and your dog. Especially in the case of a young dog the work we do will be something that benefits the dog and their humans for an entire lifetime. We can also teach old dogs new tricks and heal psychological scars. I care about the work that I do and will not sell you services you and your dog don't need.

| Cost     | Service                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
|   $30.00 | 15 minute refresher and growth session |
|   $55.00 | 30 minute refresher and growth session |
|  $100.00 | One hour session                       |
|  $500.00 | 5 day program                          |
|   Custom | A custom program for your dog          |

The 15 and 30 minute sessions are generally for only the dog and the trainer but when appropiate these can include the dog's human family members. Often it is best to combine these short sessions with doggy day care or full day boarding because it provides a stimulating experience for the dog.

The one hour session is for one dog and up to four human family members.

For the five day program the dog lives with me at my home for one full week of bonding, training, and overall psychological development. On the first and final day the dog's family and I will meet to discuss the goals of the week and assess the outcomes.
