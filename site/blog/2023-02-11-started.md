I started <b>K9Sit.com</b> on <b>Feb. 11th, 2023</b> to provide dog psychology
services in North Raleigh.

The following is a short video showing what psychology is all about. My focus
is to look beyond "dog training" so I can help dogs feel comfortable and
confident in society and build better relationships with their families.
