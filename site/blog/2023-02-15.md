Zeus is a strong high energy dog who had a big problem pulling on the leash.

When a 70 pound Pit Bull is pulling at the leash it scares people. It is also no fun to walk when the dog is dragging people around. In such a large job this is a risky behavior because he could pull over his owners. Zeus is also **potentionally** dangerous with other dogs because he has not had much socialization and might not handle a confrontation well. In Zeus's mind he just wants to rush over to people and other dogs to give love and play but with his size the issue could get out of control since he does not yet understand how to manage his mental state.

I am working with him to help him become a better neighborhood dog. One technique that helps him with his excessive energy is walking stairs. This simple experience helps him walk in sync with his handler. It is also great exercise for the dog and owner.
