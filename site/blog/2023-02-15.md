Zeus is a strong high energy dog who had a big problem pulling on the leash.

When a 70 pound Pit Bull is pulling at the leash it scares. It is no fun to walk a dog when he is dragging people around. It is also a very risky behavior because he could pull over his owners. I am working with him to help him become a better neighborhood dog. One technique that helps him with his excessive energy is walking stairs.

This simple experience helps him walk in sync with his handler. It is also great exercise for the dog and owner.
