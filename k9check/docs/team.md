**Christian Scharphorn, Lead Dog Trainer**

Christian grew up around dogs and has been working professionally as a dog
trainer for over a decade. He has found that every breed of dog was designed
for a different job and each of these breeds come with their own challenges due
to a lot of their natural instincts. With his experience he is our expert on
the behavior challenges associated with many working breeds. His extensive
knowledge allows him to create customize(custom) training packages that are
more effective. He has an uncanny ability to anticipate how dogs will react in
different situations. His view is that dogs are not born aggressive or
destructive, what he has observed is that dogs need to feel fulfilled in life
and this need for work varies depending on the breed. His experience helps him
to teach people how they can use their dogâ€™s natural instincts to train them
into the dog that they want to be with forever.
