# Dog Walking
Any healthy dog can walk well on the leash. Good walks are critical for dogs
to maintain mental and physical health. The **K9Sit.com** dog walk is a
premium experience. Our walks integrate a bit of dog training into the
activity of the walk.

## Service Providers
While our dog walking service is not formally part of our dog training service
the service complements the training experience. Our dog walkers focus on a
positive experience for dogs and never use harsh "corrections". When a
**K9Sit.com** service provider walks a dog they do so using the techniques our
trainers recommend for walking a dog.

The service providers we use for walking dogs with our **lead dog trainers**
help build and maintain their walking skills. We feel that the walk is a
critical part of a dog's day. Bad behaviors are reinforcement or created when
walks are not done well. In addition to providing your dog a bit of exercise
and recreation our dog walking service helps your dog to be a good dog using
consistent positive reinforcement. Since all our dog walking service providers
have met with and been approved by one of our lead trainers you can be
confident that a dog walk provided by **K9Sit.com** will be a great experience
for your dog.

Our service providers apply the following rules on every walk.

1. Poop is always picked up!
2. The dog is provided water at the start of the walk and at least once every 30 minutes
3. The walk is tracked via GPS
4. The dog must wear a collar with a name tag, contact information, and rabbies tag
5. Leashes similar to the [Cesar Millan Slip Lead Leashâ„¢ - Slip Collar Training Lead](https://www.amazon.com/Cesar-Millan-Leash-Training-Regular/dp/B071PDPZK6) are used
6. Dogs are never allowed to pull the service provider around _(The service provider will wait and/or change direction)_
7. Dogs must stop and sit and before crossing streets
8. Dogs are not allowed to lunge, bark, or growl at dogs or people
9. Painful tools such as prong and electric shock collars are **NEVER** used
10. The dog have fun!
