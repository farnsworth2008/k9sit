allows our service providers to provide top quality sevices at low prices. Our
service provider network is tied to an oversite model to ensure that all

**K9Sit.com** all team members are supported with a network that ensures we

## Customer Communication
Once a service provider is approved the **K9Sit.com** software and call center
takes care of all customer communications, billing, scheduling, and review
management. Our service providers are able to focus exclusivly on providing the
best possible in-person experience for our clients and their dogs.

We do not keep dogs in warehouse style kennel style facilities. We believe that
family dogs do best when they are in residential environments. Our service
providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat them as visiting guests. Our
daycare, overnight care, and training programs are conducted in home and
neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable and happy. This model
avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog who is normally a
member of a family is placed in a large and inpersonal kennel. We find that
this model helps dogs respond better to training.

Our dog training, dog sitting, doggy daycare, and dog walking service providers
will have not compete against each other. The **K9Sit.com** software matches
clients with service providers based on location and availability. Services are
defined on **K9Sit.com** with up front pricing. Our service providers earn more
than other home and/or mobile based online pet care marketplaces. We work in 
in teams at **K9Sit.com** with a structure that allows us to benefit from a
network of skilled professionals.
