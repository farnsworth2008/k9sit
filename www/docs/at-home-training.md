# At Home Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners.

We provided dog training **AT YOUR HOME** and/or in your area with pick-up and
drop-off. For the **AT HOME** services the dog stays with you in your home and
you are part of most or all of the training sessions. Our trainers will visit
with you and your dog in your home to work through issues specific to your dog.

### $65 -- 40 Minute Private Training Session
Our forty minute private training sessions are an easy way for owners and
their dogs to work with us.

The private training sessions allows us to meet with you and your dog. When we
meet, we will discuss dog training in the context of your dog. This is a chance
for you to learn how you can improve your dog's behavior on your own or with
our various training packages. We can dig into your dog's specific issues. We
adapt our training engagements for the needs and goals of every dog and owner.

Call or text us schedule services. Sessions can be conducted in your home, a
public park, the home of one of our dog trainers, via online meeting, or
another location based on where the customer and service provider are located.

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** to learn more.

### $425 -- Basic Training Package
Our basic puppy or dog at home package helps you train your dog. You and the
trainer work to customize a package of one day of boarding plus a block of five
hours of training time.

For the basic package, we may recommend the use e-collar, prong-collars,
muzzles, halti, special harnesses, and/or other tools depending on what the dog
and the owners need. We instruct the owner in how to use these tools correctly
and help them introduce the tools to their dogs.

We usually start this package with the boarding session in the trainers home.
This period helps the trainer to develop an understanding of your dog and plan
for how the block of training time will be most effective. Often the five hours
of training time is delivered over the course of a month with sessions of
twenty to sixty minutes that fit the needs of the dog and owner.
