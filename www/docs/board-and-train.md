# Board and Train Programs
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When in our training
programs or when their owners are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes
of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes with **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** where dogs are in a comfortable environnment and can
learn important life skills.

We believe that family dogs should always be in residential family
environments. In our programs dogs stay in the homes with a trainer and their
family. Our service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our
clients dogs as visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style
facilities in our approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs
are conducted in home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable
and happy. This model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog
who is normally a member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of
strange dogs. We find that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

We also believe that our model of training family dogs and service animals in
residential neighborhood settings, public areas, and dog parks is better then
warehouse style kennels, rural farms, and/or industrial parks. We do not want 
our dogs kept in environments with non-stop barking, isolation, or loneliness
because we have seen dog develop psycholoical problems from institutional
living. Our goal is to create confident dogs with great communication skills
because we know our model produces outstanding results.

Our growing network of full and part-time dog trainers allows us to be placed
in small family environments where they have between one and four other dogs
living in a shared household with a trainer. Our network allows owners to work
with a dog trainer who lives close to their home. Dogs that need _extra_
special care are work with the most experienced trainers in our network. The
**K9Sit.com** business model puts all our trainers in touch with other
**lead**, **head**, and **principal** trainers in our network. We keep owners
updated daily with photos and video. We encurage owners to visit with their dog
and their dog trainer often during our training programs.

A **non-refundable** **50%** deposit is required to schdule a dog for one of
our **Board and Train** programs. Prior to paying the deposit owners will meet
in-person or virtually with the trainer who will handle their dog. Owners must
sign our [Training Agreement document](https://k9sit.com/K9Sit.com-Board-and-Train-Agreement.pdf)
and pay the full price of the program prior to the start of the first day of
our training programs.

### $1,475 -- 14 Day Board and Train
Our fourteen day program provides a block of time where a trainer can work with
your dog. In this program the dog lives with the trainer. Most dogs will learn
all the basic obedience commands suchas **sit**, **down**, **stay**, **come**,
etc.

### $2,500 -- 21 Day Board and Train
Our twenty one day program is a great for puppies and/or adult dogs because
really when owners have high expectations two weeks is not enough time for the
training goals we often want to see. Dogs in our three week program should be
able master all skills needed for obedience and will leave with communication
skills that allow owners to easily work with their dogs.

## Service Dog Training
For an additional **$500** dollars, we will evaluate your dogs and complete the
paperwork needed for the [North Carolina Service Animal](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/vocational-rehabilitation-services/independent-living-people-disabilities/service-animals-people-disabilities) registration
process provided the dog has an appropriate temperament and can be successfully
trained to provide services that meet the legal requirements defined by the
Americans with Disabilities Act. Within the evaluation period our trainers will
test dogs for temperament in a variety of settings and work with the dog to
resolve issues.
