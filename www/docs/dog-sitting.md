# Dog Sitting
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When their owners
are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes of **K9Sit.com** service
providers. These are homes with **trust**, **respect**, and **love** where dogs
are in a comfortable environnment.

In our dog sitting program, your dog may stays in the home of one of our dog
trainers, an assistant dog trainer, or a part time dog sitter we work with. Our
service providers represent our brand and as such we are very selective. Your
dog is safe and comfortable with us.

The people who provide services for our network of experienced pet sitters love
having well behaved guest dogs in their homes. We only accept well trained dogs
for dog sitting or doggie day. You must be able to demonstrate that your dog
can pass the [K9Sit.com "Green" Test](the-test) or [The AKC Canine Good Citizenâ„¢ test](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/)
to qualify for our dog sitting program. We do not require the test for puppies
under seven months of age who are enrolled in our training programs.

Dog or puppy that has signs of separation anxiety, mild aggression, and/or
other problems can stay in our **K9Sit.com** dog sitting service where we work
with them to manage and hopefully resolve the issue in our
[dog training](dog-training) program where we train and rehabilitate dogs.
