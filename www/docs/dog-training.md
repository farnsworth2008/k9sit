# Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When in our training
programs or when their owners are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes
of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes with **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** where dogs are in a comfortable environnment and can
learn important life skills.

We offer [training in your home](at-home-training) as well as
[board and train](board-and-train) programs that can help transform the
relationship you have with your dog. We can help with all breeds of dogs and
all types of training issues.

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** so we can discuss your specific
situation.
