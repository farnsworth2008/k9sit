# Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When their owners
are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes of **K9Sit.com** service
providers. These are homes with **trust**, **respect**, and **love** where dogs
are in a comfortable environnment.

We believe that family dogs should live in residential family environments. In
our programs dogs stay in the homes with the trainer and his/her family. Our
service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our clients dogs as
visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style facilities in our
approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs are conducted in
home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable and happy. This
model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog who is normally a
member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of strange dogs. We find
that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

We also believe that our model of training family dogs and service animals in
residential neighborhood settings, public areas, and dog parks is better then
warehouse style kennels, rural farms, and/or inustrial parks. We do not want 
our dogs kept in environments with non-stop barking, isolation, or loneliness
because we have seen dog develop psycholoical problems from institutional
living. Our goal is to create confident dogs with great communication skills
because we know our model produces outstanding results.

## Pricing

### $125.00 -- Primary K9 Package (two 45 minute sessions)
Our **Primary K9 Training** package is how all clients get started at
**K9Sit.com**.

The primary training package is how all customers get started. We adapt our
primary K9 package for the needs and goals of every dog and owner. We will
discuss the dog's current behaviors, goals, and coach you and your dog or puppy
to provide the skills needed to improve.

The K9 Training package includes two 45 minute sessions. These sessions are
usually delivered over two or three consecutive weeks. This allows me to get
to know you and your dog. For some dogs/owner teams this is all that is needed
while others will want to go further and develop an on-going trainer
relationship. Often with puppies, there is a benefit to having this program
once when the puppy is between 10 weeks and five months old. Once the puppy is
older we can do the adult version of this program.

In the primary K9 package we evaluate behavior problems such as leash
reactivity, anxiety, and aggression. In some cases we are able to resolve
immediately resolve minor and moderate issues. For issues that are complex
we can create a plan and implement it with subsequent training sessions.

Call or text us schedule services.

### $175.00 -- Six Hour K9 Training Day
Our six hour training day care is a great way to improve your dog. This is a
perfect way to refresh skills in a dog that has been previously trained but
needs a bit of remedial work. For a well trained dog this can be an alterative
to traditional doggie daycare and a way to improve their skills. A dog in this
program spends the day at the home of a **K9Sit.com** trainer. The dog gets a
huge amount of individual attention over the course of the day. The trainer
engages the dog with exercise, play, and human bonding in addition to periods
of focused training work. The dog's owner can meet with the **K9Sit.com**
trainer for around 20 minutes at the end of the training day to discuss their
dog's progress and future needs.

These sessions can be integrated with our pet sitting, dog walking, or doggy
daycare services.

After the training day the dog owner will be provided a written status report. If
needed recommendations for future training will be described in this report.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.

### $750.00 -- Three Day Program
Our three day board and train package allows us to create and improve your
dog's communication skills. This package can often be scheduled for a period of
time when you are traveling. The work we perform in this package is based on
what your dog needs and how they learn.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.

### $1530.00 -- Two Week Program
Our two week program is a 14 day program where the dog spends three days in the
home of one of our trainers followed by eight days in the home of the dog's
family or with a **K9Sit.com** approved dog sitter. The dog is once again in
the home of the trainer for the final three days. The dog must attend training
days in the home of the trainer on each of the fourteen days.

### $3875.00 -- Three Week Program
Our three week board and train program is the best way to help your dog build a
good psychological framework for communication. This package allows the trainer
to spend enough time with your dog to work through issues to become a great
neighborhood dog. At the conclusion of this training the dog should be able to
pass the [K9Sit.com Green Test](the-test), [The AKC Canine Good Citizenâ„¢ test](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/),
and/or impress your friends. We offer a 100% Guarantee on this training. Any
dog without severe psychological problems should pass these tests after
receiving our training. If you are not completly satified with your
**K9Sit.com** experience at the conclusion of our training we will help you
select and provide free training on an adopted rescue dog from an area shelter
or provide free training on a dog from an breeder who is part of the AKC's
[Breeder of Merit Program](https://www.akc.org/breeder-programs/akc-breeder-of-merit-program/).

Our three week package is ideal for a young dog getting started in life or an
older dog that needs to improve their communication skills. This package can
also help rehabilitate dogs that have behavioral issues. We can repair damage
from puppyhood trauma, abuse.  We can often help dogs recover from damage
caused by other trainers who use harsh aversive in large factory style kennels.

Our program focus on giving dogs a **calm** **comfortable** **confidence** so
they can live full and rewarding lives with their families. Dogs who have
**confidence** are a joy to be around and do suffer from problems with neurotic
anxiety problems, random agression, excessive barking, or other psychological
issues. Our program is called a **Board and Train** but really we view training
as a secondary goal vs. building the **calm** **comfortable** **confidence** we
like to see in dogs. A dog with **confidence** will be obedient through love as
opposed to fear and manipulation.
