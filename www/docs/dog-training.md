# Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is a new company. We started operations on **March 1st of 2023**.
Currently we have very low pricing to reward customers who take a leap of faith
and work with us.

**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When in our training
programs or when their owners are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes
of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes with **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** where dogs are in a comfortable environnment and can
learn important life skills.

We believe that family dogs should always be in residential family
environments. In our programs dogs stay in the homes with a trainer and their
family. Our service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our
clients dogs as visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style
facilities in our approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs
are conducted in home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable
and happy. This model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog
who is normally a member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of
strange dogs. We find that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

We also believe that our model of training family dogs and service animals in
residential neighborhood settings, public areas, and dog parks is better then
warehouse style kennels, rural farms, and/or industrial parks. We do not want 
our dogs kept in environments with non-stop barking, isolation, or loneliness
because we have seen dog develop psycholoical problems from institutional
living. Our goal is to create confident dogs with great communication skills
because we know our model produces outstanding results.

Our growing network of full and part-time dog trainers allows us to be placed
in small family environments where they have between one and four other dogs
living in a shared household with a trainer. Our network allows owners to work
with a dog trainer who lives close to their home. Dogs that need _extra_
special care are work with the most experienced trainers in our network. The
**K9Sit.com** business model puts all our trainers in touch with other
**lead**, **head**, and **principal** trainers in our network. We keep owners
updated daily with photos and video. We encurage owners to visit with their dog
and their dog trainer often during our training programs.

A **non-refundable** **50%** deposit is required to schdule a dog for one of
our **Board and Train** programs. Prior to paying the deposit owners will meet
in-person or virtually with the trainer who will handle their dog. Owners must
sign our [Training Agreement document](https://k9sit.com/K9Sit.com-Board-and-Train-Agreement.pdf)
and pay the full price of the program prior to the start of the first day of
our training programs.

### $75 -- One Hour Private Training Session
Our private training sessions provide an easy way for owners and their dogs to
start working with us.

The private training sessions allows us to meet with you and your dog. When we
meet, we will discuss dog training in the context of your dog. This is a chance
for you to learn how you can improve your dog's behavior on your own or with
our various training packages. We can dig into your dog's specific issues. We
adapt our primary K9 package for the needs and goals of every dog and owner.

The primary package can be scheduled as often as needed as a way for dog owners
to interact with dog trainers for private one-on-one mentoring.

Call or text us schedule services. Sessions can be conducted in your home, a
public park, the home of one of our dog trainers, via online meeting, or
another location based on where the customer and service provider are located.

### $225 -- Four Week Course
Our training course for dogs and their owners provide one 45 minute group
meeting per week for four weeks. The course is limited to a maximum of three
dogs. The group meets on Wednesday nights at 6pm. Each meeting is either at the
home of one of our dog trainers or at a nearby park. For this training we focus
on the basics of good dog obedience and work through the issues various members
of the group are having with their dogs.

The basic format of each session is the same each week. The K9Sit.com trainer
provides an overview of the weeks focus and then leads the group through some
exercises they can do with their dogs. The session always includes a short walk
where the trainer leads the group and helps dogs and owners apply training
within the context of a walk.

Owners are given specific exercises to use as "homework" between the times when
when the group meets.

obedience. For dogs that have good fundemental skills we can work to get them
