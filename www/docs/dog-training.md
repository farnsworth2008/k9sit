# Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When in our training
programs or when their owners are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes
of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes with **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** where dogs are in a comfortable environnment and can
learn important life skills.

We believe that family dogs should always be in residential family
environments. In our programs dogs stay in the homes with a trainer and their
family. Our service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our
clients dogs as visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style
facilities in our approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs
are conducted in home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable
and happy. This model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog
who is normally a member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of
strange dogs. We find that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

We also believe that our model of training family dogs and service animals in
residential neighborhood settings, public areas, and dog parks is better then
warehouse style kennels, rural farms, and/or industrial parks. We do not want 
our dogs kept in environments with non-stop barking, isolation, or loneliness
because we have seen dog develop psycholoical problems from institutional
living. Our goal is to create confident dogs with great communication skills
because we know our model produces outstanding results.

Our growing network of full and part-time dog trainers allows us to be placed
in small family environments where they have between one and four other dogs
living in a shared household with a trainer. Our network allows owners to work
with a dog trainer who lives close to their home. Dogs that need _extra_
special care are work with the most experienced trainers in our network. The
**K9Sit.com** business model puts all our trainers in touch with other
**lead**, **head**, and **principal** trainers in our network. We keep owners
updated daily with photos and video. We encurage owners to visit with their dog
and their dog trainer often during our board and train program.

A **non-refundable** **$200** deposit is required to schdule a dog for one of
our **Board and Train** programs. Owners must also sign our
[Board and Train Agreement document](https://k9sit.com/K9Sit.com-Board-and-Train-Agreement.pdf)
and pay the full price of the program prior to the start of the first day of
our Board and Train programs.

## Pricing
We adjust the prices for our services on the 1st of each month based on a
number of factors.

issues. We adapt our primary K9 package for the needs and goals of every dog
and owner.

The primary package can be scheduled as often as needed as a way for dog owners
to interact with dog trainers for private one-on-one mentoring.

### $100.00 -- Training Day Care Program
Our training day care program provides your dog with up to ten hours of doggie
daycare combined with dog training. In this program the dog spends the day in
the home of a **K9Sit.com** dog trainer. Over the course of the day the dog
receives training focused individualized attention. The training day care
program provides a way for an owner to work with a trainer while still keeping
their dog in their own home and observing incremental results.

In general, our training day care program is most benifical for dogs that have
already participated in a longer board and train program or owners who are
prepared to schedule several days of daycare. Training builds up over time such
that when working with a new dog the first few hours or days are mostly a time
for the dog and the trainer to get to know each other.

Call or text us schedule services.

### $125.00 -- One Day Program
Our one day program is a simple way to allow one of our trainers to work with

been trained but needs a bit of remedial work. This can be an alterative to
traditional doggie daycare and a way to improve their skills. A dog in this
program spends the day at the home of a **K9Sit.com** trainer. The dog gets a
huge amount of individual attention over the course of the day. The trainer
engages the dog with exercise, play, and human bonding in addition to periods
of rest alternated with focused training work. The trainer and the dog's owner
will also work together to address the dog's needs.

### $1,750.00 -- Three Week Program
Our three week program is a great programs for puppies and/or adult dogs. We do
not recommend this intensive training for puppies in the window of time between
six and ten months since that period is a time of growth and hormonal changes.
Within the six to ten month period, puppies need **rules**, **bounderies**, and
**limitations** but this chaotic time in puppyhood is not a good for highly
structured training and as such our standard three week program avoids the
unstable months of late puppyhood.

In this program most dogs will master the skills needed for communication and
obedience.

The dog's owner is welcome to join the trainer for as much as one
hour per day training time if their schedule allows.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.

### $2,200.00 -- Four Week Program
Our four week program provides your dog with an entire month where they live
with and work with one of our trainers. Any dog without health problems should
can be expected to become an amazing dog in this program.

### $2,450.00 -- Five Week Program
Our five week program is the best way to help your dog build a great
psychological framework for communication. This package allows the trainer
to spend enough time with your dog to work through issues to become a great
neighborhood dog. At the conclusion of this training the dog should be able to
pass the [K9Sit.com Green Test](the-test), [The AKC Canine Good Citizenâ„¢ test](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/),
and/or impress your friends. Any dog without health problems should pass these
tests after receiving our training.

Our five week program is ideal for a young dog getting started in life or an
older dog that needs to improve their communication skills. This package can
also rehabilitate dogs that have behavioral issues. We can repair damage from
puppyhood trauma, abuse. We can often help dogs recover from damage caused by
other trainers who use harsh negative techniques and/or manage dogs in large
factory style kennels.

Our program focus is on creating dogs who are **calm**, **comfortable**, and
**confidence**. Dogs who have **confidence** are a joy to be around and do
suffer from problems with neurotic anxiety problems, random agression,
excessive barking, or other psychological issues. A dog with **confidence**
will be obedient through love as opposed to fear and manipulation.

The dog's owner is also welcome to join the trainer for as much as one
hour per day training time if their schedule allows.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.

### $3,250.00 -- Six Week Puppy and Young Adult Dog Program
Our six week board and train program for puppies is a great way to get a
massive head start in creating an awesome dog. We recommend that puppies start
this program at an age of around ten weeks because it is a cricial time in
their development. Mistakes made in puppyhood are hard to repair so if you are
not 100% confident in your abilties and/or do not have the time for puppy care
allowing one of our trainers to handle these first three weeks after the puppy
leaves a breeder program is a wise investment. The six week puppy and young
adult program is not offered for any puppy older than fourteen weeks.

While in this program, the puppy lives and travels with the trainer for three
weeks starting sometime between eight and fourteen weeks of life. After
fourteen weeks the older puppy lives with the owner. When the puppy is ten
months old it spends another three weeks with the trainer to complete our young
adult program. Every aspect of the puppy program is focused on building puppy
confidence. The puppy program includes positive oriented training delivered in
a way that **never** places the puppy under stress. Puppies need **A LOT** of
care and socilaization; in this program they get everything that is needed.
When puppies get this type of dedicated care when they are young are much
easier to train and generally do better in life.

The dog's owner is also welcome to join the trainer for as much as one
hour per day training time if their schedule allows.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.
