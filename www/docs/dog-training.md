# Dog Training
K9Sit.com is a company with a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their
owners by providing reasonablly priced services for dogs and their owners.
The best outcome for dogs and their owners comes from developing **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** through better communication. The investment you
make in building communication with your dog will change both of your lives.

We believe that family dogs should be in residential family environments. In
our programs dogs stay in the homes with the trainer and his/her family. Our
service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our clients dogs as
visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style facilities in our
approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs are conducted in
home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable and happy. This
model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog who is normally a
member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of strange dogs. We find
that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

## Pricing

### $125.00 -- Primary K9 Package (two 45 minute sessions)
Our **Primary K9 Training** package is how all clients get started at
**K9Sit.com**.

I adapt the program for the needs of every dog/owner team. The primary training
package is how all customers get started. We will discuss the dog's current
behaviors, goals, and coach you and your dog or puppy to provide the skills
needed to improve.

The K9 Training package includes two 45 minute sessions. These sessions are
usually delivered over two or three consecutive weeks. This allows me to get
to know you and your dog. For some dogs/owner teams this is all that is needed
while others will want to go further and develop an on-going trainer
relationship. Often with puppies, there is a benefit to having this program
once when the puppy is between 10 weeks and five months old. Once the puppy is
older we can do the adult version of this program.

In the primary K9 package we will evaluate behavior problems such as leash
reactivity, anxiety, and aggression. In some cases we are able to resolve
immediately resolve minor and moderate issues. For issues that are complex
we can create a plan and implement it with subsequent training sessions.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.

### $75.00 -- 45 minute K9 Session
These private training sessions allow me to work with you and/or your dog to
maintain and grow skills. These short sessions are conducted with me, one dog,
and one dog owner. In these sessions we work on specific issues for the dog.
These sessions can also be included as add-ons for pet sitting, walks, and/or
doggy daycare.

### $175.00 -- 6 hour K9 training session
Our six hour training day care is a great way to improve your dog. This is a
perfect way to refresh skills in a dog that has been previously trained but
needs a bit of remedial work. For a well trained dog this alterative to
traditional doggie daycare is a way to improve skills. A dog in this program
spends the day at the home of a **K9Sit.com** trainer. The dog gets a huge
amount of individual attention over the course of the training day. The dog's
owner can meet with the **K9Sit.com** trainer for around 20 minutes at the end
of the training day to discuss their dog's progress and future needs.

The [Primary K9 Training](#12500----primary-k9-training-two-45-minute-sessions) package

After the training day the dog owner will be given a written report with

described in this report.

time when you are traveling. The work we perform in this package is based on
what your dog needs and how they learn.
