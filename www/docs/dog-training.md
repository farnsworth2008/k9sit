# Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is a new company. We started operations on **March 1st of 2023**.
Currently we have very low pricing to reward customers who take a leap of faith
and work with us.

**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When in our training
programs or when their owners are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes
of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes with **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** where dogs are in a comfortable environnment and can
learn important life skills.

We believe that family dogs should always be in residential family
environments. In our programs dogs stay in the homes with a trainer and their
family. Our service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our
clients dogs as visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style
facilities in our approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs
are conducted in home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable
and happy. This model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog
who is normally a member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of
strange dogs. We find that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

We also believe that our model of training family dogs and service animals in
residential neighborhood settings, public areas, and dog parks is better then
warehouse style kennels, rural farms, and/or industrial parks. We do not want 
our dogs kept in environments with non-stop barking, isolation, or loneliness
because we have seen dog develop psycholoical problems from institutional
living. Our goal is to create confident dogs with great communication skills
because we know our model produces outstanding results.

Our growing network of full and part-time dog trainers allows us to be placed
in small family environments where they have between one and four other dogs
living in a shared household with a trainer. Our network allows owners to work
with a dog trainer who lives close to their home. Dogs that need _extra_
special care are work with the most experienced trainers in our network. The
**K9Sit.com** business model puts all our trainers in touch with other
**lead**, **head**, and **principal** trainers in our network. We keep owners
updated daily with photos and video. We encurage owners to visit with their dog
and their dog trainer often during our training programs.

A **non-refundable** **50%** deposit is required to schdule a dog for one of
our **Board and Train** programs. Prior to paying the deposit owners will meet
in-person or virtually with the trainer who will handle their dog. Owners must
sign our [Training Agreement document](https://k9sit.com/K9Sit.com-Board-and-Train-Agreement.pdf)
and pay the full price of the program prior to the start of the first day of
our training programs.

### FREE -- Initial Consultation
We provide a free Initial Consultation for dog owners. We can meet at the home
of one of our trainers, at a dog park, in the client's home, or using a virtual

### $40 -- 20 Minute Private Training Session
Our twenty minute private training sessions are an easy way for owners and
their dogs to work with us.

The private training sessions allows us to meet with you and your dog. When we
meet, we will discuss dog training in the context of your dog. This is a chance
for you to learn how you can improve your dog's behavior on your own or with
our various training packages. We can dig into your dog's specific issues. We
adapt our primary K9 package for the needs and goals of every dog and owner.

The primary package can be scheduled as often as needed as a way for dog owners
to interact with dog trainers for private one-on-one mentoring.

Call or text us schedule services. Sessions can be conducted in your home, a
public park, the home of one of our dog trainers, via online meeting, or
another location based on where the customer and service provider are located.

### $550 -- 3 Day Board and Train
Our three day program allows us to improve a dog's communication skills with a
small block of training. This program can often be scheduled for a period of
time when you are traveling. The work we perform in this program will be based
on what your dog needs and how they learn. In this short program, we can establish
foundation that can later help the dog acheive a high level of confidence and
obedience. For dogs that have good fundemental skills we can work to get them
to that next level of performance.

The dog's owner is welcome to join the trainer for as much as thirty
minutes per day training time if their schedule allows.

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** to learn more.

### $625 -- 4th of July Board and Train
Our **4th of July** program helps dogs overcome their irrational fear of
fireworks. In this special three day program, we help dogs to change the way
they experience the Independence Day celebrations. We use exercise, positive
reinforcement, and confidence building sessions to help dogs process the
experience with less stress and fear.

Owners should register as early as possible. This program is limited to a
small number of dogs and is expected to fill quickly.

Dogs must arrive no later then **1pm** on the **2nd** of July and leave no
later then **1pm** on the **5th** of July.

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** to learn more.

### $1,275 -- 7 Day Board and Train
Our seven day program is similar to our three day program but goes a but
further in the work of building a framework for a dog's communication and
obedience.

The dog's owner is welcome to join the trainer for as much as 45 minutes per
day for training time if their schedule allows.

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** to learn more.

### $2,125 -- 14 Day Board and Train
Our fourteen day program provides twice the training of our one week program.
In this program, most dogs will learn all the basic obedience commands such
as **sit**, **down**, **stay**, **come**, etc.

The dog's owner is welcome to join the trainer for as much as one hour per day
of training time if their schedule allows.

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** to learn more.

### $2,975 -- 21 Day Board and Train
Our twenty one day program is a great for puppies and/or adult dogs because
really when owners have high expectations two weeks is not enough time for the
training goals we often want to see. Dogs in our three week program should be
able master all skills needed for obedience and will leave with communication
skills that allow owners to easily work with their dogs.

The dog's owner is welcome to join the trainer for as much as one hour per day
training time if their schedule allows. Within the context of the 28 day
program you may work with your dog trainer to arrange home visits where your
spends a day and night at your home. The home visits do not count against the
block of training days. Some home visits simply extend the calendar period
associated with the training and are a great way to make it easier to
transition to and from the board and train experience.

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** to learn more.

### $3,875 -- 28 Day Board and Train
Our twenty eight day program provides your dog with a large block of time to
live with and work with one of our trainers. Dogs benefit from the extra time
with the trainer as they perfect their skills.

The dog's owner is welcome to join the trainer for as much as one hour per day
training time if their schedule allows. Within the context of the 28 day
program you may work with your dog trainer to arrange home visits where your
spends a day and night at your home. The home visits do not count against the
block of training days. Some home visits simply extend the calendar period

transition to and from the board and train experience.

For an additional **$500** dollars we can evaluate dogs and complete the
paperwork needed for the [North Carolina Service Animal](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/vocational-rehabilitation-services/independent-living-people-disabilities/service-animals-people-disabilities) registration process provided
the dog has an appropriate temperament and can be successfully trained to
provide services that meet the legal requirements defined by the Americans with
Disabilities Act. Within the evaluation period our trainers will test dogs for
temperament in a variety of settings.

## Guaranteed Results
All of our training is delivered with our **100% satisfaction guarantee**. If
you are not completely satisfied with the training we provided we will make
things right. You have the right to demand a refund of all or part of the cost
of the dog training.

We hope customers will not abuse our refund policy but we are willing to take a
risk on the portion of the costs related to dog training. We always do the best
work possible for any dog. We hope customers will see the improvements in their
dogs but also understand that no dog is ever perfect. The costs assocated with
boarding are not part of the potential refund amount and as such, if at the
end of a board and train engagement you feel totally disastified with the
training result you may request a refund of the training cost but no refund
will be provided for the cost of boarding the dog in the period.

We generally adjust the prices for our services on the **1st of each month**
