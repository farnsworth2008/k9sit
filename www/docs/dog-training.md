# Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When in our training
programs or when their owners are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes
of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes with **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** where dogs are in a comfortable environnment and can
learn important life skills.

We believe that family dogs should always be in residential family
environments. In our programs dogs stay in the homes with a trainer and their
family. Our service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our
clients dogs as visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style
facilities in our approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs
are conducted in home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable
and happy. This model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog
who is normally a member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of
strange dogs. We find that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

We also believe that our model of training family dogs and service animals in
residential neighborhood settings, public areas, and dog parks is better then
warehouse style kennels, rural farms, and/or industrial parks. We do not want 
our dogs kept in environments with non-stop barking, isolation, or loneliness
because we have seen dog develop psycholoical problems from institutional
living. Our goal is to create confident dogs with great communication skills
because we know our model produces outstanding results.

Our growing network of part-time dog trainers allows dogs to be placed in small
family environments where they have between one and four other dogs living in a
shared household with a trainer. Our network allows owners to work with a dog
trainer who lives close to their home. Dogs that need _extra_ special care are
work with the most experienced trainers in our network. Our business model puts
all our trainers in touch with other lead, head, and principal trainers in our
network. We keep owners updated daily and when possible encurage them to visit
with their dog and their dog trainer often durring our board and train program.
For dog's with very difficult **red zone** problems such as aggression with
humans we charge an extra $100 per day because they can only be managed by
our head and principal trainers.

## Pricing

### $75.00 -- Primary K9 Package (two 45 minute sessions)
Our **Primary K9 Training** package is an easy way to start working with us.

The primary training package allows us to meet with you and your dog. When we
meet we can discuss your dog's specific problmes and make recommendations. In
the 45 minute we can do a bit of train-the-human to help you understand the
best ways to interact with your dog. We adapt our primary K9 package for the
needs and goals of every dog and owner. We will discuss the dog's current
behaviors as it compares with your goals. We can coach both you and your dog to
at minimum point you in the right directions.

The **Primary Package** includes two 45 minute sessions. These sessions
delivered over two or three consecutive weeks. This allows our trainer to get
to know you and your dog. For some dogs this is all that is needed while
other dogs need an on-going trainer relationship. Often with puppies, there is
a benefit to having this program once when the puppy is between 10 weeks and
five months old. Once the puppy is older we can do the adult version of this
program.

In the primary K9 package we evaluate behavior problems such as leash
reactivity, anxiety, and aggression. In some cases we are able to immediately
resolve minor and moderate issues. For issues that are complex we can discuss
approaches to address the problem with subsequent training sessions and/or
exercises the owner can do on their own.

### $125.00 -- One Day Program
Our one day program is a simple way to allow one of our trainers to work with
your dog. This is a perfect way to refresh skills in a dog that has previously
been trained but needs a bit of remedial work. For a well trained dog, this can
be an alterative to traditional doggie daycare and a way to improve their
skills. A dog in this program spends the day at the home of a **K9Sit.com**
trainer. The dog gets a huge amount of individual attention over the course of
the day. The trainer engages the dog with exercise, play, and human bonding in
addition to periods of rest alternated with focused training work. The trainer
and the dog's owner will also work together to address the dog's needs.

The dog's owner is also welcome to join the trainer for as much as three hours
of the training time.

Our three day program allows us to improve a dog's communication skills in a
small block of training. This program can often be scheduled for a period of
time when you are traveling. The work we perform in this program will be based
on what your dog needs and how they learn. In this short program, we can establish
foundation that can later help the dog acheive a high level of confidence and
obedience. For dogs that are already have good fundemental skills we can work
to get them to that next level of performance.

hour per day training time if their schedule allows.

### $2,800.00 -- Three Week Program
Our three week program is a great programs for puppies and/or adult dogs. We do
not recommend this intensive training for puppies in the window of time between
six and ten months since that period is a time of growth and hormonal changes.
Within the six to ten month period, puppies need **rules**, **bounderies**, and
**limitations** but this chaotic time in puppyhood is not a good for highly
structured training and as such our standard three week program avoids the
unstable months of late puppyhood.

In this program most dogs will master the skills needed for communication and
obedience.

The dog's owner is welcome to join the trainer for as much as one
hour per day training time if their schedule allows.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.

### $3,225.00 -- Four Week Program
Our four week program provides your dog with an entire month where they live
with and work with one of our trainers. Any dog without health problems should
can be expected to become an amazing dog in this program.

### $3,975.00 -- Five Week Dog Program
Our five week program is the best way to help your dog build a great
psychological framework for communication. This package allows the trainer
to spend enough time with your dog to work through issues to become a great
neighborhood dog. At the conclusion of this training the dog should be able to
pass the [K9Sit.com Green Test](the-test), [The AKC Canine Good Citizenâ„¢ test](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/),
and/or impress your friends. Any dog without health problems should pass these
tests after receiving our training.

Our five week program is ideal for a young dog getting started in life or an
older dog that needs to improve their communication skills. This package can
also rehabilitate dogs that have behavioral issues. We can repair damage from
puppyhood trauma, abuse. We can often help dogs recover from damage caused by
other trainers who use harsh negative techniques and/or manage dogs in large
factory style kennels.

Our program focus is on creating dogs who are **calm**, **comfortable**, and
**confidence**. Dogs who have **confidence** are a joy to be around and do
suffer from problems with neurotic anxiety problems, random agression,
excessive barking, or other psychological issues. A dog with **confidence**
will be obedient through love as opposed to fear and manipulation.

The dog's owner is also welcome to join the trainer for as much as one
hour per day training time if their schedule allows.

### $4,345.00 -- Six Week Puppy and Young Adult Dog Program
Our six week board and train program for puppies is a great way to get a
massive head start in creating an awesome dog. We recommend that puppies start
this program at an age of around ten weeks because it is a cricial time in
their development. Mistakes made in puppyhood are hard to repair so if you are
not 100% confident in your abilties and/or do not have the time for puppy care
allowing one of our trainers to handle these first three weeks after the puppy
leaves a breeder program is a wise investment. The six week puppy and young
adult program is not offered for any puppy older than fourteen weeks.

While in this program, the puppy lives and travels with the trainer for three
weeks starting sometime between eight and fourteen weeks of life. After
fourteen weeks the older puppy lives with the owner. When the puppy is ten
months old it spends another three weeks with the trainer to complete our young
adult program. Every aspect of the puppy program is focused on building puppy
confidence. The puppy program includes positive oriented training delivered in
a way that **never** places the puppy under stress. Puppies need **A LOT** of
care and socilaization; in this program they get everything that is needed.
When puppies get this type of dedicated care when they are young are much
easier to train and generally do better in life.

The dog's owner is also welcome to join the trainer for as much as one
hour per day training time if their schedule allows.

Call or text us to discuss or schedule services.
