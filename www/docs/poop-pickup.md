# Poop Pickup
It is important to pick up the poop in your yard.

Dogs don't enjoy living in the bathroom.

Poop in the yard is also unhealthy for pets and other family members.

One of the services that we offer is to pick up poop in your yard. This
service can be provided on its own or in conjuntion with other services
we provide.

### $0.00 -- **Free** poop pickup service
At **K9Sit.com** we do not like walking dogs in neighborhoods where poop is not
picked up. When a **K9Sit.com** dog walker encounters dog poop they stop and
pick it up even if the poop was left behind by another dog. Adding these extra
stops to our walks produces a training effect because it is an opportunity for
the **K9Sit.com** service provider to interup the dog, make them sit and relax
then calmly pick up poop. Over time this helps the dogs become better
neighborhood dogs who will respect the human on the other end of the leash.
Since we also often walk in the same neighborhoods picking up dog poop also
makes sense because it means our next walk will be a little nicer.

If you know of an area that needs service and have seen the yellow hats of
**K9Sit.com** service providers walking in the neighborhood please text us
with a description of the problem area. We offer the free service for poop
in neighborhoods public areas or along the side of sidewalks. We provide this
service as a free secondary part of our dog walks and as such we have a limited
amount of time for poop pickup but we will track areas and when possible stop
and pick up the poop. 

The following is an example text:

```text title="TO: 919-809-9328"
There is a problem with dog poop in the 5401 North neighborhood near the
fitness park near the intersection of Beardall and Perry Creek.
```

### $45.00 -- 20 minute poop pickup service for private yards 
Call or text to schedule services.

**919-809-9328**

### $2.00 per mile -- service provider travel fee

We charge a travel fee to cover the travel time and cost our service
providers require to reach your home. The travel fee is $2.00 per mile based
on the Google maps driving distance from our nearest service provider. We will
provide you a quote of the travel costs prior to scheduling service.
