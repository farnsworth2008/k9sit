# The K9Sit.com Green Test
The **K9Sit.com** neighborhood dog test is a simple tool we use to evaluate
dogs on a scale from 1 to 10. This test is performed as part of our standard
evaluation for all dogs we work with. The test must occur in a dog park with
at least two other unleashed dogs present to ensure that the dog is able to
follow directions while in a distracting environment. Electric training collars
are not allowed for this test. The handler is not allowed to give the dogs any
treats until the test is complete. Voice and body language commands are allowed
but the handler may not physically touch the dog.

<hr />

## Part 1 -- Walking with the Handler
The dog must walk for 50 feet along side the handler while unleashed and while
at least two dogs are present in the dog park. The dog must remain focused on
the handler while walking to the place where the "sit" command will be issued. 

## Part 2 -- The "sit" command
The dog must sit on command.

## Part 3 -- The "stay" command
The dog must remain in the sitting position from the time the handler issues a
"stay" command.

## Park 4 -- 50 feet away from the dog
The dog must remain in the sit position as the handler walks 50 feet away from
the dog to the point where the test started.

## Part 5 -- The "down" command
The handler must issue a "down" command from 50 feet away. The dog must change
to the "down" position and remain in the down position until the "come" command
is issued. The period of time the dog is in the down position must be at least
ten seconds.

## Part 6 -- The "come" command
The handler issues the "come" command and the dog must return to the handler.

<hr />

The test must be completed in under 60 seconds.

A dog that passes the **K9Sit.com** will generally have the emotional control
needed to be successful in most of the tasks we expect a well trained
neighborhood dog to perform. At **K9Sit.com**, passing this test is required
before a dog is allowed to wear a green collar.
