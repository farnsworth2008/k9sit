# The K9Sit.com Green Test
The **K9Sit.com** neighborhood dog test is a simple tool we use to evaluate
dogs. This test is performed as part of our standard evaluation for all dogs we
work with. The handler is not allowed to give the dogs any treats until the
test is complete. Voice and body language commands are allowed but the handler
may not physically touch the dog during the test.

<hr />

## Part 1 -- Move to the Test Point
The dog must walk with the handler to the **Test Point**. which is 50 feet away
from the start point. At the **Test Point** the handler must give the dog a
command to assume the "sit" position.

## Part 2 -- The "stay" command
The dog must remain in the sitting position as the handler walks back to the
start point.

## Park 3 -- The "down" command
The handler must issue the "down" command only from the starting point and must
be 50 feet away from their dog. The dog must change to the "down" position and
remain in the down position until the "come" command is issued.

## Part 4 -- The "come" command
When the handler issues the "come" command and the dog returns the test is
completed. The **short format** test must be completed within 60 seconds.

## Part 5 -- The long format
The **long version** of the test is the same as the **short version** with the
only change being that the dog must remain in the down position for one full
minute and must not bark, whine, or jump on the handler durring the test.

<hr />

A dog that passes the **K9Sit.com** will generally have the emotional control
needed to be successful in most of the tasks we expect a well trained
neighborhood dog to perform. At **K9Sit.com**, passing this test is required
before a dog is allowed to wear a green collar.
