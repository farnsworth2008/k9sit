# The K9Sit.com Test
The **K9Sit.com** neighborhood dog tests are simple tools we use to evaluate
dogs. The **Red**, **Green**, an **Blue** tests are performed as part of our
evaluations. In these tests, the handlers are not allowed to give or show the
dogs any treats until the tests are complete.

Voice and body language commands are allowed but the handler may not physically
touch the dog during the test. If a dog gets distracted and fail the test, we
can run through the test a few times in the same session to see if the dog can
pass the test on a second attempt.

The **Red** test determines if the dog walks smoothly on the leash.

The purpose of the **Green** test is to determine if the dog has good control
over their emotional state. The "remote down" command portion of this test is
in particular difficult to master.

The **Blue** test determines if the dog suffers from separation anxiety.

## Basic Test -- Sit, Down, Stay, Come
At the start of an dog's evaluation we determine if the dog and it's hander
are able to demonstrate a basic level of control with the four basic commands

## Red Test -- Walk for twenty minutes
For the **Red Test** the owner simply walks the dog for twenty minutes around
in their neighborhood using a leash which is attached to the dogs collar such
that it is linked using a zip tie that has an 18 pound tensile strength rating.
A secondary slack leash must also be attached to the dog collar and the
handler's belt to keep the dog secure if the the zip-tie breaks.

We consider the test to be a failed attempt If the zip-tie breaks on the walk.

54 4M## Green Tes t -- Part 1 -- Move to the Test Point
The dog must walk with the handler to the **Test Point**. which is 50 feet away
from the start point. At the **Test Point** the handler must give the dog a
command to assume the "sit" position.

## Green Test -- Part 2 -- The "stay" command
The dog must remain in the sitting position as the handler walks back to the
start point.

## Green Test -- Part 3 -- The "down" command
The handler must issue the "down" command only from the starting point and must
be 50 feet away from their dog. The dog must change to the "down" position and
remain in the down position until the "come" command is issued.

## Green Test -- Part 4 -- The "come" command
When the handler issues the "come" command and the dog returns the test is
completed. The **short format** test must be completed within 60 seconds.

## Green test -- Part 5 -- The long format
The **long version** of the test is the same as the **short version** with the
only change being that the dog must remain in the down position for one full
minute. To pass the green test, all five parts must be completed without
barking, whining, jumping up on the handler durring the test.

A dog that passes the **K9Sit.com Green Test** will generally have the
emotional control needed to be successful in most of the tasks we expect a well
trained neighborhood dog to perform. At **K9Sit.com**, passing this test is
required before a dog is allowed to wear a green collar.
