**Mark Farnsworth CEO, CTO, Dog Trainer**
_(Cheif Operating Officer, Cheif Technology Officer)_

Mark is the founder of the **K9Me.com**, **K9Check.com**, and **K9Sit.com**
brands. Mark serves as the **CEO** and **CTO** for all three brands. In
addition to his primary role leading the companies Mark works as a **Dog Trainer**
for [K9Sit.com in Raleigh, NC](https://raleigh-nc.K9Sit.com/), as a **Handler**
for **K9Check.com**, and as a mentor for **K9Me.com**.

As a young child, Mark spent five years in a special school run by Doctor
Elizabeth Missakian where he learned important lessons about animal psychology.
As a clinical psychologist Mrs. Missakian was an expert in the behavoir of
primates. Mark participated in research for a book about the Social Play of
Primates. This experience was the start of Mark's life long interest in
the psychology of animals.

Mark has over thirty years of experience in software development and
leadership.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s Mark was part of two successful technology
start-ups. He holds a patent for one of the first successful handheld medical
applications used in major hospital systems. In the past few years Mark was a
key part of software development teams at LabCorp where he created important
components for one of the first at-home **COVID** testing platform. Most
recently Mark worked as a cloud computing expert for before starting
**K9Me.com**, **K9Check.com**, and **K9Sit.com**.

Mark loves working with and inventing technology such as hardward and software
for dog training. His own dog often has a lighted e-collar for off leash work.
He uses the beep feature of the collar for positive reinforcement at a distance
_(similar to "clicker" training)_. Mark is also inventing technology products
that he and other trainers at **K9Me.com** will use. For on-leash work Mark has
built a special leash with a integrated scale that measures the amount of force
a dog creates when they pull at the leash. By working creativly with technology
and techniques Mark is able to create amazing results using scientific methods.

You can often see Mark and his dog Tig riding together on his motorcycle using
gear he has adapted and re-designed for the task.

Mark works closely with candidates for our our open positions as we grow the
company.

**Christian Scharphorn, Lead Dog Trainer**

Christian grew up around dogs and has been working professionally as a dog
trainer for over a decade. He has found that every breed of dog was designed
for a different job and each of these breeds come with their own challenges due
to a lot of their natural instincts. With his experience he is our expert on
the behavior challenges associated with many working breeds. His extensive
knowledge allows him to create customize(custom) training packages that are
more effective. He has an uncanny ability to anticipate how dogs will react in
different situations. His view is that dogs are not born aggressive or
destructive, what he has observed is that dogs need to feel fulfilled in life
and this need for work varies depending on the breed. His experience helps him
to teach people how they can use their dogâ€™s natural instincts to train them
into the dog that they want to be with forever.
