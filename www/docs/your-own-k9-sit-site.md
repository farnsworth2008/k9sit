# Establish your own K9Sit.com Site
My goal with this project is to improve the lives of dogs by providing a
reasonablly priced services for dogs and their owners. The best outcome for
dogs and their owners comes from developing **trust, respect, and love**
through better communication. With good communication perform well for their
humans. The best way to build good communication with dogs is for dog owners
to work with dog trainers who are members of a shared local community.

The K9Sit business model provides a platform with a simple cost structure and
a low monthly fee. Currently **K9Sit.com** only provides only a few features
but we are planning to add calendar schduling, reviews, and other stuff as
soon as possible.

We charge **$100.00** to assit you in the creation off a new **K9Sit.com**
site. After your site has been established we charge only **$20.00** per month
to host your site. If you need us to edit your content pages or implement
specific features for you we charge **$50.00** per hour for custom site work.

Your site can share your phone numbers and links to your profiles for Facebook,
LinkedIn, Rover, Youtube, and/or other sites. We will support you in adding
buttons for PayPal and/or other services so your clients will be able to use
your **K9Sit.com** pages to learn about your services and pay you without any
transaction fees. Your site will also have your own Blog to help you engage
with your clients and share YouTube videos.

The basic **K9Sit.com** site includes features similar to
the <a href="https://ne-raleigh-nc.k9sit.com/">North East Raleigh, NC</a> site.
Your site can have up to four service pages and six PayPal buttons while on the
standard plan. You can also publish one blog entry per week.

Use the following button to buy the **K9Sit.com** Site Setup service. We will
phone you after you pay for this service we can discuss your site content. You
can also call me at 919-809-9328 to dicuss the **K9Sit.com** project. We are
just now getting started with the project and as such we don't yet have any other
