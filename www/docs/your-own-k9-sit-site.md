# The K9Sit.com Platform
My goal with the **K9Sit.com** project is to improve the lives of dogs by
creating a platform that helps dog owners find the very best service providers.
**K9Sit.com** service providers provide high quality services for dog sitting,
dog walking, doggy daycare, dog grooming, and dog training.

The best outcome for dogs and their owners comes from developing **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** through better communication. With good
communication, dogs are happy and perform well for their humans. The best way
to build good communication with dogs is for dog owners to work with dog
trainers who are members of their community.

The **K9Sit.com** business model provides an online platform with a simple
cost structure for consumers. As the brand grows the value increases for
everyone who is involved.

The current **K9Sit** site template provides a blog page plus up to four
service pages. Typical service pages will be for items such as `Dog Training`,
`Dog Grooming`, `Dog Walking`, `Dog Sitting`, etc. We are focused on dogs on
the `k9sit.com` domain. We plan to add additional domains for similar services
targeting other types of pets. Not all locations will provide all services.

Becuase pet care is a business where providers and customers operate in small
local areas we feel that the `k9sit.com` domain is ideal since it is easy for
customers to remember. The top page at `www.k9sit.com` provides a directory of
sites that exist in specific markets such as `ne-raleigh-nc.k9sit.com` for the
service I provide in **North East Raleigh**. The new sites will be created
using a similar naming pattern such as `sw-springfield-tx.k9sit.com`. Once a
customer uses the top level page they can bookmark their prefered locations.
The top level page of the **K9Sit.com** site will help consumers connect with
service providers.

The basic **K9Sit.com** site includes features similar to the
[North East Raleigh, NC](https://ne-raleigh-nc.k9sit.com/) site. You can
publish up to one blog entry per week. The fee structure is defined on a per
site basis. The team at **K9Sit.com** takes care of all site edits and manages
the initial phone and text interaction with clients. Each site has a calendar
system to manage scheduled services.

The value of the brand depends on the delivery of well defined high quality
services. All **K9Sit.com** member service providers represent our brand and
must be approved by our oversight team. The oversight team will interview all
prospective **K9Sit.com** service providers. We will consider certification as
we evaluate potential providers. We also place a great deal of value on the
endorsement of people working in animal rescue organizations that operate
in various local community. We also require background checks. Interviews and
reference checks are repeated every six months. Applicants must participate in
our online training and pass our rigorous tests before they are approved as
services providers.

Once a service provider is approved we will take care of all customer
communications, billing, schduling, and review management in a way that allows
our service providers to focus exclusivly on providing the best possible
in-person experience for our clients and their dogs.

We do not use kennel style facilities in our approach. We believe that family
dogs should stay in family and residential environments while in our programs.
Our service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat them as visiting
family members. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs are
conducted in a home settings where the dogs are comfortable and happy. This
model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog who is normally
a member of a family is placed in a large and inpersonal kennel. We find that
this model helps dogs respond better to training.

Our dog trainng, dog sitting, doggy daycare, and dog walking service providers
will have not compete against each other. The K9Sit.com software will match
clients with providers based on location and availability. The expecations for
the services will be well defined in **K9Sit.com** online training and the
prices will be set such that our service providers earn more vs. other home
and/or mobile based online pet care marketplaces.

The **K9Sit.com oversight** team will remove any site from our if we determine
a provider does not represent the quality standards for our brand.

Call or text **K9Sit.com** at **919-809-9328** to discuss the **K9Sit.com**
project and schdule an interview if you would like to be part of this exciting
new brand.
