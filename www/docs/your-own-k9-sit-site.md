# The K9Sit.com Platform
My goal with the **K9Sit.com** project is to improve the lives of dogs by
creating a platform that helps dog owners find the very best service providers.
**K9Sit.com** service providers provide high quality services for dog sitting,
dog walking, doggy daycare, dog grooming, and dog training.

The best outcome for dogs and their owners comes from developing **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** through better communication. With good
communication, dogs are happy and perform well for their humans. The best way
to build good communication with dogs is for dog owners to work with dog
trainers who are members of their community.

The **K9Sit.com** business model provides an online platform with a simple
cost structure for consumers. As the brand grows the value increases for
everyone who is involved.

The current **K9Sit** site template provides a blog page plus up to four
service pages. Typical service pages will be for items such as `Dog Training`,
`Dog Grooming`, `Dog Walking`, `Dog Sitting`, etc. We are focused on dogs on
the `k9sit.com` domain. We plan to add additional domains for similar services
targeting other types of pets. Not all locations will provide all services.

Becuase pet care is a business where providers and customers operate in small
local areas we feel that the `k9sit.com` domain is ideal since it is easy for
customers to remember. The top page at `www.k9sit.com` provides a directory of
sites that exist in specific markets such as `ne-raleigh-nc.k9sit.com` for the
service I provide in **North East Raleigh**. The new sites will be created
using a similar naming pattern such as `sw-springfield-tx.k9sit.com`. Once a
customer uses the top level page they can bookmark their prefered locations.
The top level page of the **K9Sit.com** site will help consumers connect with
service providers.

The basic **K9Sit.com** site includes features similar to the
[North East Raleigh, NC](https://ne-raleigh-nc.k9sit.com/) site. You can
publish up to one blog entry per week. The fee structure is defined on a per
site basis. The team at **K9Sit.com** takes care of all site edits and manages
the initial phone and text interaction with clients. Each site has a calendar
system to manage scheduled services.

The value of the brand depends on the delivery of
high quality services. All **K9Sit.com** member sites must agree to our
policies and be approved by our oversight team. In addition to an interview
with our oversight team all prospective **K9Sit.com** site must provide a
references. We place a great deal of value on endorsements with from people
working in animal rescue organizations that operate in various local community.
We also require background checks. Interviews and reference checks are repeated
every six months. The **K9Sit.com Oversight** team has the right to remove any
site from our domain at any time if we determine a specific provider is not
representing the quality standards for our brand.

Call or text **K9Sit.com** at **919-809-9328** to discuss the **K9Sit.com**
project and schdule an interview if you would like to be part of this exciting
new brand.
