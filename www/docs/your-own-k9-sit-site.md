# Creating a K9Sit.com Site
Please read on if you are a dog trainer or interested in becoming one.

My goal with the **K9Sit.com** project is to improve the lives of dogs and dog
trainers by creating a reasonably priced platform for small dog training
businesses.

The best outcome for dogs and their owners comes from developing **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** through better communication. With good
communication, dogs are happy and perform well for their humans. The best way
to build good communication with dogs is for dog owners to work with local dog
trainers who are members of their community.

The **K9Sit.com** business model will provide the online platform with a simple
cost structure using a low monthly fee. Currently the **K9Sit.com** site
provides only a few features but we are planning to add calendar scheduling,
review management, and other features. Our early customers will help us define
what features are the most important.

The current **K9Sit** template provides a Blog page plus up to four service
pages. Typical service pages will be for items such as `Dog Training`,
`Dog Grooming`, `Dog Walking`, `Dog Sitting`, etc. We are focused on dogs on
the `k9sit.com` domain. We plan to add additional domains for similar services
targeting other types of pets.

Becuase pet care is a business where providers and customers operate in small
local areas we feel that the `k9sit.com` domain is ideal since it is easy for
customers to remember. The top page at `www.k9sit.com` provides a directory of
sites that exist in specific markets such as `ne-raleigh-nc.k9sit.com` for the
service I provide in **North East Raleigh**. The new sites will be created
using a similar naming pattern such as `sw-springfield-tx.k9sit.com`. Once a
customer uses the top level page they can bookmark their prefered locations.

We charge **$200.00** for the creation of **K9Sit.com** sites. After the site
has been established we charge only a low monthly fee for hosting the content.
If you need us to edit content pages or implement specific features for you we
charge a low hourly fee for custom work. Your site will be a simple clean web
presence that is free of advertisements. You can print business cards or order
some from us. Over time, the **K9Sit.com** brand will grow similar to how Lyft,
Uber, AirBnB, and Rover have become well known.

Currently, the fee for hosting a site is only **$25 per month**. We do not
charge any transaction fees for when customers book training services. This
monthly fee is an introductory rate. The monthly fee will likely be increased
next year but the fee will always be as low as possible while still allowing
us to develop the features needed to provide the best possible online presence
for our customers. Our web pages are a simple mobile friendly design that look
good on all major web browsers. We are already in the early planning stages for
the creation of a **K9Sit** mobile app.

Your site can share your phone numbers and links to your profiles for Facebook,
LinkedIn, Rover, Youtube, and/or other sites. We will support you in adding
buttons for PayPal and/or other services so your clients will be able to use
your **K9Sit.com** pages to learn about your services and pay you without any
transaction fees. Your site will also have a blog to help you engage with your
clients and share YouTube videos. You can have your own business name on your
site pages. On your site you control the relationship with your customer and
most of the content of the pages. The domain name **K9Sit.com** is easy for
customers to remember. The top level pages of **K9Sit.com** will direct
customers to the location that is closest to them. Locations will not compete
against each other because dog training and dog sitting services are a local
concern for the end users.

The basic **K9Sit.com** site includes features similar to
the [North East Raleigh, NC](https://ne-raleigh-nc.k9sit.com/) site. You can
publish one blog entry per week. Over the next few months the structure of the
site template will evolve based on what we learn from end users.

All **K9Sit.com** member sites must agree to our policies and be approved by
our oversight team. In addition to an interview with our oversight team any
prospective **K9Sit.com** site must provide a reference from someone working
in an animal rescue organization that operates in their local community.

Interviews and reference checks are repeated every six months. All
**K9Sit.com** member sites must foster an adoptable dog in their community for
at least three weeks or provide an equivalent level of involvement with a
rescue organization.

The **K9Sit.com Oversight** team has the right to remove any site from our
domain at any time if we determine a specific provider is not representing
the quality standards for our brand.
