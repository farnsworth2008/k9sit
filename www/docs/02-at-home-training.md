# At Home Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners.

We provided dog training **AT YOUR HOME** and/or in your area with pick-up and
drop-off. For the **AT HOME** services the dog stays with you in your home and
you are part of most or all of the training sessions. Our trainers will visit
with you and your dog in your home to work through issues specific to your dog.

Our packages provide positive reinforcement training. We show you how to reward
your dog and design a plan that will produce the best possible results. Most
interactions the dog has with a trainer and/or the owner in this program are
based on positive rewarding for good behavior and non-rewarding bad behavior.
We may put the dog in an environmental context that includes prong collars,
choke chains, and/or e-collars when we have shown the owner the proper use of
these tools for behavior modification. 

### $625 -- Basic Training Package
Our basic puppy or dog at home package helps you train your dog. The trainer
visits you in your home to work with you and/or your dog. You and the trainer
work to customize a package with ten hours of training in your home. This
training is usually delivered over the course of a one month period.

### $1,275 -- Advanced Training Package
Our advanced puppy or dog at home package helps you train your dog. The trainer

training in your home. This training is usually delivered over the course of a
three month period.

### $?,??? -- Custom Training Package
Custom sized training packages can be created provided they are larger than the
advanced training package although really the price per hour will not change
very much.

### $1 per mile -- Travel Rate
