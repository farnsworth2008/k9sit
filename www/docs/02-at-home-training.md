# At Home Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners.

We provided dog training **AT YOUR HOME** and/or in your area with pick-up and
drop-off. For the **AT HOME** services the dog stays with you in your home and
you are part of most or all of the training sessions. Our trainers will visit
with you and your dog in your home to work through issues specific to your dog.

Our packages provide positive reinforcement training. We show you how to reward
your dog and design a plan that will produce the best possible results. Most
interactions the dog has with a trainer and/or the owner in this program are
based on positive rewarding for good behavior and not-rewarding bad behavior.
In cases where the dog benefits from other tools we show you the proper way to
use prong collars, e-collars, slip leads, and other tools. Our primary focus is
positive reinforcement but we are not opposed to using these tools as
communication aids.

Science published in recent decades shows that traditional spay/neuter
procedures harm the health and behaivor of dogs. We provide a 10% discount for
any intact dogs in our programs. We want to help you and your dog live your
best lives. We are completely opposed to using traditional spay/neuter to alter
behavior. In cases where owners need surgical steralization we can refer you to
veterinarians who perform modern ovary sparing spay and vasectomies. By
offering a small discount for hormonally intact dogs we hope to encurage
customers to avoid the procedure. We also prefer working with dogs that have
healthy hormonal systems because they respond better to training.

### $30 -- 30 Minute Training Walk
Our thirty minute training walk provides a dog walking service combined with
training. The training will help your dog develop or improve loose leash
walking skills. At various places along the walk your dog will be given small
training sessions for Sit, Down, and other commands. In open areas your dog
will have a chance to sniff and explore using a long line.

### $60 -- 40 Minute Private Training
