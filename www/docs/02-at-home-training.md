# At Home Dog Training
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners.

We provided dog training **AT YOUR HOME** and/or in your area with pick-up and
drop-off. For the **AT HOME** services the dog stays with you in your home and
you are part of most or all of the training sessions. Our trainers will visit
with you and your dog in your home to work through issues specific to your dog.

### $625 -- Basic Training Package
Our basic puppy or dog at home package helps you train your dog. The trainer
visits you in your home to work with you and/or your dog. You and the trainer
work to customize a package with ten hours of training in your home. This
training is usually delivered over the course of a one month period.

### $1,275 -- Advanced Training Package
Our advanced puppy or dog at home package helps you train your dog. The trainer
visits you in your home to work with you and/or your dog. You and the trainer
work to customize a package of two days of boarding plus thirty hours of
training in your home. This training is usually delivered over the course of a
three month period.

This advanced package builds on positive reinforcement training while also
better defining the role the owner and/or trainer manipulates the environment.
We show you how to create environments where the dog can receive feedback about
their actions. Every interaction the dog has with a trainer or their owner uses
positive rewarding for good behavior and non-rewarding bad behavior. We may put
the dog in an environmental context that includes prong collars, choke chains,
and/or e-collars. 

Please call or text us at **919-809-9328** to learn more.
