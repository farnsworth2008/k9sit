# Products We Like
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. We do not sell
products and do not recieve any kick back of referal fee. The products listed
on this page are the products we recommend for dog owners with a brief
description of how we recommend using the product.

### Martingale Collars
[Max and Neo Waterproof Martingale Collar](https://www.maxandneo.com/collections/dog-collars/products/waterproof-martingale-dog-collar)
We use Max and Neo Waterproof martingale collars on every leash walk. We recommend fitting this collar *high and tight* with a two figners of free space when worn alone. When the martingale collar is worn in conjuntion with a prong collar we recommend that the prong fit *high and tight* with the martingale fit lower so both can be used at the same time.

### Prong Collars
We use Herm Springer swivel style prong collars such as the [2.25mm black stainless steel](https://www.rayallen.com/herm-sprenger-martingale-style-pinch-collar-black/) model. For most dogs we recommend the 2.25mm size.
Prong collars should almost always be paired with a martingale collar and sized to fit at the highest point of the
neck.

### Electric Collars
We use SportDog e-collars such as the [SportHunter 825x](https://www.sportdog.com/e-collars/sporthunter-825x/) model.

### Dog Crates
We use [SMONTER](https://www.amazon.com/stores/SMONTER/page/E66BC228-D9E4-4DD6-BDA4-DFA187A77C21) heavy duty steel crates.

### Crate Pad
We use the [K9 Ballistics Armored Crate Pad](https://k9ballistics.com/collections/crate-kennel/products/chew-proof-armored-dog-crate-pad?variant=17946461372487)

### Remote Treat System
We use the [INSTACHEW Purechew Treat Dispenser](https://www.chewy.com/instachew-purechew-snack-cat-dog/dp/757670) with a camera so we can spy on dogs and reward them from a distance.

### Retractable Leash

[Flexi Giant Retractable Leash Extra Large](https://www.amazon.com/Flexi-Giant-Retractable-Leash-Extra-Large/dp/B01FTX9LRU?ref_=ast_sto_dp)
