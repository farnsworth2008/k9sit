# Board and Train Programs
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. When in our training
programs or when their owners are traveling dogs are able to stay in the homes
of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes with **trust**,
**respect**, and **love** where dogs are in a comfortable environnment and can
learn important life skills.

We believe that family dogs should always be in residential family
environments. In our programs dogs stay in the homes with a trainer and their
family. Our service providers keep dogs in their own homes and treat our
clients dogs as visiting guests. We do not warehouse style kennel style
facilities in our approach. Our daycare, overnight care, and training programs
are conducted in home and neighborhood settings where the dogs are comfortable
and happy. This model avoids the stress that would otherwise occur when a dog
who is normally a member of a family is placed in a kennel with a lot of
strange dogs. We find that our model helps dogs respond better to training.

We also believe that our model of training family dogs and service animals in
residential neighborhood settings, public areas, and dog parks is better then
warehouse style kennels, rural farms, and/or industrial parks. We do not want 
our dogs kept in environments with non-stop barking, isolation, or loneliness
because we have seen dog develop psycholoical problems from institutional
living. Our goal is to create confident dogs with great communication skills
because we know our model produces outstanding results.

Our growing network of full and part-time dog trainers allows us to be placed
in small family environments where they have between one and four other dogs
living in a shared household with a trainer. Our network allows owners to work
with a dog trainer who lives close to their home. Dogs that need _extra_
special care are work with the most experienced trainers in our network. The
**K9Sit.com** business model puts all our trainers in touch with other
**lead**, **head**, and **principal** trainers in our network. We keep owners
updated daily with photos and video. We encurage owners to visit with their dog
and their dog trainer often during our training programs.

A **non-refundable** **50%** deposit is required to schdule a dog for one of
our **Board and Train** programs. Prior to paying the deposit owners will meet
in-person or virtually with the trainer who will handle their dog. Owners must
sign our [Training Agreement document](https://k9sit.com/K9Sit.com-Board-and-Train-Agreement.pdf)
and pay the full price of the program prior to the start of the first day of
our training programs.

Science published in recent decades shows that traditional spay/neuter
procedures harm the health and behaivor of dogs. We provide a 10% discount for
any intact dogs in our programs. We want to help you and your dog live your
best lives. We are completely opposed to using traditional spay/neuter to alter
behavior. In cases where owners need surgical steralization we can refer you to
veterinarians who perform modern ovary sparing spay and vasectomies. By
offering a small discount for hormonally intact dogs we hope to encurage
customers to avoid the procedure. We also prefer working with dogs that have
healthy hormonal systems because they respond better to training.

### $2,500 -- 21 Day Basic Board and Train

### $4,000 -- 42 Day Foundational Board and Train
Our forty two day program provides a block of time where a trainer can work
with your dog to establish a relationship and build communication skills. In
this program the dog lives with the trainer for several days per week. When
possible we want the owner to keep the dog in their home for two or three days
per week. Depending how many days the dog spends with the owner the program
will be betwee six and tweleve weeks since the program is based on the number
of days the dog spends with the trainer.

### $4,000 -- 42 Day Advanced Board and Train
