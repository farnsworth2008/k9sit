# Dog Sitting
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. Dogs in our care
stay in the homes of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes where we
provide dogs with **trust**, **respect**, and **love**.

In our dog sitting program, your dog stays in the home of one of our dog
trainers, an assistant dog trainer, or a part time dog sitter we work with. Our
service providers represent our brand and as such we are very selective. Your
dog is safe and comfortable with us.

The people who provide services for our network of experienced pet sitters love
having well behaved guest dogs in their homes. In our program your dog lives
with a family in a home and is treated as a special guest. The dog will have a
lot of fun and will also practice good behavior. Providers in our network are
either certified dog trainers or have been checked out by our trainers to
ensure that the home is safe and the provider understands how to provide the
top quality experience our brand delivers.
