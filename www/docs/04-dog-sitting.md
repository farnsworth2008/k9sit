# Dog Sitting
**K9Sit.com** is on a mission to improve the lives of dogs and their owners by
providing high quality services for dogs and their owners. Dogs in our care
stay in the homes of **K9Sit.com** service providers. These are homes where we
provide dogs with **trust**, **respect**, and **love**.

In our dog sitting program, your dog stays in the home of one of our dog
trainers, an assistant dog trainer, or a part time dog sitter we work with. Our
service providers represent our brand and as such we are very selective. Your
dog is safe and comfortable with us.

The people who provide services for our network of experienced pet sitters love
having well behaved guest dogs in their homes. We only accept well trained dogs
for dog sitting. You must be able to demonstrate that your dog has passed the
[AKC Canine Good Citizenâ„¢ test](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/)
to qualify for our dog sitting program. We do not require the test for puppies
under seven months of age and may waive the requirement for dogs enrolled in
our training programs.

## Pricing
- $55.00 per day -- 24 hour dog sitting
