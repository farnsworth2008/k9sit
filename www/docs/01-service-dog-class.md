# Service Dog Training Course
Our four week service dog training class meets at **6 PM** on Thursday's at
various places in North East Raleigh, NC. When needed, we adjust the schedule
and/or have additional meetings on other days of the week. Classes are limited
to a maximum of four dogs. The class will be a walking/rolling process where we
explore an area and perform training activites in public places. All locations
will have wheelchair access.

In addition to behaviors, we discuss laws related to brining your dog into public
areas as a service animal. We train dogs to meet and exceed the expecations the
public has in terms of behavior. In this training, you will learn how to handle
your dog in challenging public environments. In addition to the class time we
will have homework exercises. Not every dog and handler team will graduate
after taking the course one time. When needed dog owners will be encuraged to
retake the course because we will only graduate if the handler and the dog are
successful in all public places.

Behaviors we work on in the class are as follows:

- Focus
- Touch
- Impulse Control
- Loose Leash Walking _(in public with distractions)_
- Positioning _(tucking under tables and out of the way)_
- Sit and Down _(focus, duration, distraciton, and release)_
- On/Off Switch for energy management

We expect that you dog be reasonablly well trained prior to this class. In the
class we help you and your dog improve your teamwork so you can meet and exceed
the expecations the public has for service dogs and their handlers.

### Course Start Dates
- Oct. 5th 2023
- Nov. 2nd 2023
- Nov. 30th 2023

### Session 1
In the first session, we dicuss laws related to service dogs in the USA, North
Carolina, Wake County, and the city of Raleigh, NC. We also discuss
expectations the public has for **service dogs** and **service dogs in training**.
In this session, we will get to know each other and work on calming and impulse
control exercises for dogs the group.

### Session 2
In the second session, we conduct relationship building exercises to increase
the value dogs see in their handler and the tasks of working in public. The
lecture part of the session focus on the concepts to help handlers understand
how dogs view the experience of working in public. After the short lecture we
will perform focus, touch, sit, and down exercises for the remainder of the
class time.

### Session 3
For the third session our focus is making sure we operate smoothly in various
public spaces. Service dogs are expected to tuck out of the way and refain from
enaging with other humans and dogs. We will work on exercises to help dogs
understand context so they can succeed. Our primary tool for this will be the
concept of placement so the dog understands their expected position relative to
their handler as well as in the context of meals, meetings, pathways, etc.

### Session 4
In the final session for the course, our primary topic is impulse control when
in highly distracting environments and while walking with a loose leash. I will
support dog and handler teams that are performing well with the process of
North Carolina Service Dog Registration. For dog and handler teams that still
need additional work after the course is complete we will discuss problem areas
and create a plan for continued training. 

### Cost
The cost for the course is $475 per dog. A maximum of six dogs will be in the
program on any given month. Each dog may be accompanied by one primary handler
up to two additional humans.
