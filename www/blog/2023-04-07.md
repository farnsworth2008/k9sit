At **K9Sit.com** we train **ALL** our dogs to be calm, comfortable, and
confident while wearing a muzzle. We require **ALL** to be comfortable with
wearing muzzles, shoes, goggles, as well as collars with "gentle leader" style
head control. When a dog refuses to wear equipment a human has insisted the dog
wear we have a situation where the dog is not respecting the humans. Dogs that
understand how to wear muzzles and other gear are dogs that respect humans and
are confident that "everything will be okay." In our training programs, we
insist that training a dog to wear safety gear is part of the process.

Even if your dog does not have a history of bite agression it is important that
they be comfortable wearing a muzzle. A muzzle is a tool that may at sometimes
be needed if the dog has a veterinary appointment. The muzzle can also be
needed if the owner finds themselves in a situations where the muzzle can be
useful. Even if the dog is not at all dangerous there may be times when wearing
a muzzle is needed to help others people feel comfortable.

Training a dog who as a history of biting humans to wear a muzzle requires a
lot of patience and must be done carefully so the dog feels and is safe at all
times. Becomming frustrated and while doing muzzle training is dangerous for
the trainer as well as any humans who are in the area. In addition, a dog can
hurt themselves while training to remove a muzzle. Our training process is
incremental so the dog comes to see the muzzle as a good thing and does not
have a desire to remove it. This process also helps build trust, and respect
with the trainer and a framework the dog can use for communication with humans.
