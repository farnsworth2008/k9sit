I started **K9Sit.com** on <b>Feb. 10th, 2023</b> to provide dog training
services in North East Raleigh, NC.

I quickly decided that I could also provide value to the community to make it easier for others to
establish their own K9Sit.com site and work with customers in their areas.

My vision is that someday **K9Sit.com** can be like Uber for dog training.

In my view good quality dog training should be a local service where service
providers and consumers who live within in a few miles of each can work
together to improve the lives of dogs in various communities.

The following is a short video showing me with my dog.
