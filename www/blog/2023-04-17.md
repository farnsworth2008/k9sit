I recently built a system for riding on my motorcycle with my dog named Tig.

To build my system I adapated and repurposed various bits of equipment.

I have brainstormed various approaches and observed dogs in cars. My belief is
that dogs perfer standing while in fast moving and somewhat unstable vehicles
because it gives them a bit of control. We see this when we drive places with a
dog who often wants to stand and stick their head out of the window.

The first part of the system is a platform that I created using a
[Top Paw folding crate](https://www.petsmart.com/dog/crates-gates-and-containment/crates-and-kennels/top-paw-indoor-and-outdoor-portable-dog-crate-5326606.html).
The crate straps to the back of my motorcycle creating a platform that my dog
can stand on. With my setup my dog can stand or if she chooses she can allow
the backpack sling to carry her weight.

The backpack sling system I created started with a
[Dog Lift Harness Sling Carrier](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BK19QLZ6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
where my dog is securely held in place. I adapted the harness so it now
attaches to a [child carrier backpack](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/poco-POCOCHS20.html).
The backpack helps position my dog so she mostly rides in the center of the
platform. The dog is not connected to the motorcycle in any way. My dog and I
are connected together so we can communicate our feelings by moving our
bodies. Tig can lean with me on turns just like a human would do. I feel it is
to have her connected to me vs. strapping her to the motorcycle and since she
never thrashes around I don't worry about her causing problems when I ride. 

On the motorcycle at highway speeds we are often traveling in excess of eighty
miles per hour. The goggles and hearing protection we use comes from
[www.rexspecs.com](https://www.rexspecs.com). The hearing protection she wears
reduces the impact of wind noise. we have an intercom system so my dog can hear
my voice via speakers she wears under her hearing protection. The goggles she
uses fit quite well and stay in place even at high speeds.
